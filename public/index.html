  <p>My two main goals are to establish immediate action points for troubleshooting, as well as prompting the user to provide specific information that will help trace to the root of the problem as efficiently as possible.
<hr>
“Hello _______, I’m sorry to hear about the issues with your site. I’ll provide a few steps for troubleshooting, and if you could provide me with the static site generator you’re using, that will aid in making sure your configuration files are set up properly prior to running the build. We want to verify that  also the build is failing through Netlify and that there isn’t an issue with your site generators’ compiling.</p>

<p>-Here are some tips on configuring your site to build depending on the language your site generator is built on (for example, Jekyll is built with Ruby and Hugo is written in Go).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/#helpful-hints">https://www.netlify.com/docs/#helpful-hints</a></p>

<p>Are you deploying manually or is your site set for continuous deployment? Take a look at this section under ‘Deploy Context’ <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/">https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/</a></p>

<p>If those tips don’t resolve your issue or you receive a different &lsquo;build failed&rsquo; message, can you please screenshot of your terminal output so I can further diagnose the root of the issue?</p>

<p>Best,</p>

  <p>I set a time cap on this project for the weekend, and unfortunately hit my allotted cap before implementing a routing redirect. I am definitely curious about the best way to implement a redirect that changes the route into query parameters though!</p>

<p>I looked into the alias feature in Hugo but it didn&rsquo;t seem like the best solution, as it&rsquo;s intended for redirects within the same site domain, where in this case I&rsquo;d want to launch an external Google search.</p>

  <p>Using SSL/TLS with HTTP is incredibly important because there are myriad ways for individuals/organizations to intercept or read data if the SSL connection is not established. Especially with recent Internet policy changes, it’s unclear how many 3rd parties can access individual browser data if HTTPS is not enforced. Even if an application does not handle confidential information like social security numbers of financial transactions, users’ behavior can be compromised and studied through their logged metadata. It’s also becoming a more widely-implemented technology that&rsquo;s necessary for full integration across applications. It can even improve page indexing on Google search, as Google is prioritizing HTTPS-enabled web applications and sites for an improved user experience. I’ve installed HTTPS Everywhere as a Chrome Extension (<a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere</a>) to force the secure protocol connection on non-configured sites.</p>

  <p>Challenge #1: The connection between SOA records, NS(name server) records, and A (address) records.</p>

<p>From anecdotal experience, more people are familiar with the concept of an IP address and a domain name as individual concepts, but don’t understand how they’re related. Explaining the mapping between IP address numbers and name servers (what happens when you type in a URL and hit ‘search’) is important to establish before diving into the DNS record relationships. Once the concept of mapping is established, I can work with the user to run terminal commands to display and configure their A  &amp; CNAME records. If we share understanding of the aforementioned records, understanding PTR records should be clear and we can discuss more customization options if they’re interested.</p>

<p>Challenge #2: Selecting the name server software</p>

<p>Determining the users&rsquo; flavor of Linux/Unix before diving into software choices (Bind, powerDNS, djbdns, dnsmasq, etc). I would provide an existing resource (like a better-formatted version of this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_server_software">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_DNS_server_software</a>) or create a custom document comparing/contrasting some of the popular DNS software choices.  For OSX users, if they’re not familiar, I’d recommend setting up Homebrew because it is an easy tool for installing software (can also be used to install DNS software like Bind, along with some of the popular static site generators like Hugo).</p>

<p>Configuring the name server to help recognize and prevent phishing/cache poisoning would also be a priority for certain clients, and I&rsquo;d need to communicate the importance of properly setting up the various configurations in Bind, for example. The user should be comfortable pinging their DNS as a basic test for connectivity whenever they encounter an issue.</p>

  <p>I definitely would put this exercise near the top of “most enjoyable interview experiences” relative to other tests I’ve worked through (i.e., timed assessments on HackerRank) because of it’s flexibility and strong relevance to the role. I enjoy creating sample work or working through exercises. Even if it’s determined that we’re not a mutual fit at a point in the process, I feel like I benefitted from the experience regardless, and the work I completed wasn’t arbitrary. So thank you for that!</p>

<p>Initially I was wondering if it was an expectation to utilize React + build tools on this project, but after exploring Hugo the idea seemed like overkill.  Ultimately I chose not to pull in React, because I wanted to deliver the content in a clear, simplistic manner and had no need for a powerfully dynamic FE library. Additionally I’ve utilized Angular and React multiple times over the last few months and only explored this collection  of static site generators once, so I wanted this project to be oriented around utilizing new technologies.</p>

  <p>To be completely forthcoming, I started off exploring Jekyll for a bit but changed to Hugo. Ruby is my strongest language which would result in the least amount of time getting up to speed with the configurations in Jekyll, but I had heard a lot about Hugo and also had only glanced at Go before. I also disliked how Jekyll comes configured specifically for a ‘Post’ style of blog right out of the box.</p>

<p>With Hugo, the scaffolding creates a more bare-bones style setup and only through installing and configuring a theme does it end up with the structure of a blog. Because of this, I felt more flexibility in exploring Hugo, and I&rsquo;ve never seen anything build as quickly as it does on top of Go.</p>

<p>My main challenge with Jekyll was figuring out why newly created HTML would be reverted to the boilerplate whenever I added a custom partial (i.e., a nav bar) into the _ <em>includes</em> directory. It was because of the <code>bundle exec jekyll serve —watch</code> command I ran after initialization.</p>

<p>I had zero issues with Hugo, and I found their documentation + examples to be more coherent.</p>

  <p>Tech support creates a mutually beneficial relationship in a manner that is hard to find in other roles. I enjoy searching for patterns in bugs and user feedback to expedite a solution, and to ideally solve the issue from the root to address any systemic symptoms caused by the bug. The user experiences something between mild relief to radiating gratitude when their issue is resolved and they walk away with greater clarity. I enjoy working through both the simple and complex. It’s a great feeling to build mental muscle memory with certain processes and even more rewarding to learn from diving into a complex problem with a hands-on approach.</p>

  <p>Q) What are my 5 top favorite/least favorite activities?
<hr></p>

<p><h4>The Top 5</h4>
<ul>
  <li>  Set up my own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging </li>
  <li>  Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product</li>
  <li>  Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers</li>
  <li>  Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub</li>
  <li>  Debug a customer&rsquo;s build using a programming language and framework that you&rsquo;ve never seen before (realistically I&rsquo;m sure there wil be outstanding scenarios where executing this will be challenging, but still exciting in it&rsquo;s ability to expand my problem solving skills.)</li>
</ul></p>

<p><h4>The Bottom 5</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Respond to Netlify fans on Twitter (but fear not, I&rsquo;m adept at spotting trolls, and skilled at maintaining a professional brand-oriented voice) </li>
  <li> Find and recruit teammates for the support team </li>
  <li> Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers (any mild anxiety this could create will be aleviated through growing my product knowledge, along with more hands-on familiarity with multiple static site generators.) </li>
  <li> Help manage communications during a service outage </li>
  <li> Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case </li>
</ul></p>
