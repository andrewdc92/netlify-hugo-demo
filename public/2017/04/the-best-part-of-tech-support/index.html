  <p>Tech support creates a mutually beneficial relationship in a manner that is hard to find in other roles. I enjoy searching for patterns in bugs and user feedback to expedite a solution, and to ideally solve the issue from the root to address any systemic symptoms caused by the bug. The user experiences something between mild relief to radiating gratitude when their issue is resolved and they walk away with greater clarity. I enjoy working through both the simple and complex. Itâ€™s a great feeling to build mental muscle memory with certain processes and even more rewarding to learn from diving into a complex problem with a hands-on approach.</p>
