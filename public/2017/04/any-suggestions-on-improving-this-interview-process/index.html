  <p>I definitely would put this exercise near the top of “most enjoyable interview experiences” relative to other tests I’ve worked through (i.e., timed assessments on HackerRank) because of it’s flexibility and strong relevance to the role. I enjoy creating sample work or working through exercises. Even if it’s determined that we’re not a mutual fit at a point in the process, I feel like I benefitted from the experience regardless, and the work I completed wasn’t arbitrary. So thank you for that!</p>

<p>Initially I was wondering if it was an expectation to utilize React + build tools on this project, but after exploring Hugo the idea seemed like overkill.  Ultimately I chose not to pull in React, because I wanted to deliver the content in a clear, simplistic manner and had no need for a powerfully dynamic FE library. Additionally I’ve utilized Angular and React multiple times over the last few months and only explored this collection  of static site generators once, so I wanted this project to be oriented around utilizing new technologies.</p>
