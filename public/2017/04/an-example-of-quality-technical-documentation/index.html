On the landing page, Coinbase textually breaks down the use cases for their API, along with highlighting it’s more relevant capabilities. There’s a call to action-‘Start building your first app’ button, and below they provide graphical divisions for each of their API tools to reinforce the use cases that were cited in the text box above. The way that they expand upon the capabilities of their tools is analogous to an inverse pyramid- they introduce a variety of concepts on a surface level, and then provide increasingly granular resources if the individual wants to dive deep into a particular tool or configuration." />

<p>On the landing page, Coinbase textually breaks down the use cases for their API, along with highlighting it’s more relevant capabilities. There’s a call to action-‘Start building your first app’ button, and below they provide graphical divisions for each of their API tools to reinforce the use cases that were cited in the text box above. The way that they expand upon the capabilities of their tools is analogous to an inverse pyramid- they introduce a variety of concepts on a surface level, and then provide increasingly granular resources if the individual wants to dive deep into a particular tool or configuration.</p>

<p>Aesthetically it’s just a very clean documentation layout where finding and implementing information feels feasible. I also think that the way the nav bar is divided works very well, as I can quickly glance at it without feeling overwhelmed by headers/topics. As a contrasting documentation example, the Ruby docs for different class/mixin methods (<a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html">https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Enumerable.html</a>) have a verbose nav bar and it can be difficult to find an appropriate method directly through the documentation without some help from StackOverflow, or familiarity with array/integer manipulation from other languages.</p>
