Q) What are my 5 top favorite/least favorite activities?
<hr>

<h4>The Top 5</h4>
<ul>
  <li>  Set up my own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging </li>
  <li>  Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product</li>
  <li>  Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers</li>
  <li>  Submit bug reports and potentially bug fixes to closed and open source projects that Netlify maintains on GitHub</li>
  <li>  Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before (realistically I'm sure there wil be outstanding scenarios where executing this will be challenging, but still exciting in it's ability to expand my problem solving skills.)</li>
</ul>


<h4>The Bottom 5</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Respond to Netlify fans on Twitter (but fear not, I'm adept at spotting trolls, and skilled at maintaining a professional brand-oriented voice) </li>
  <li> Find and recruit teammates for the support team </li>
  <li> Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers (any mild anxiety this could create will be aleviated through growing my product knowledge, along with more hands-on familiarity with multiple static site generators.) </li>
  <li> Help manage communications during a service outage </li>
  <li> Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case </li>
</ul>
