title = "Setting Up a Redirect to Query Params "

+++

I set a time cap on this project for the weekend, and unfortunately hit my allotted cap before implementing a routing redirect. I am definitely curious about the best way to implement a redirect that changes the route into query parameters though!

I looked into the alias feature in Hugo but it didn't seem like the best solution, as it's intended for redirects within the same site domain, where in this case I'd want to launch an external Google search.
