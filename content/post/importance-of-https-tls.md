title = "The Critical Importance of SSL/TLS Encryption"

+++

Using SSL/TLS with HTTP is incredibly important because there are myriad ways for individuals/organizations to intercept or read data if the SSL connection is not established. Especially with recent Internet policy changes, it’s unclear how many 3rd parties can access individual browser data if HTTPS is not enforced. Even if an application does not handle confidential information like social security numbers of financial transactions, users’ behavior can be compromised and studied through their logged metadata. It’s also becoming a more widely-implemented technology that's necessary for full integration across applications. It can even improve page indexing on Google search, as Google is prioritizing HTTPS-enabled web applications and sites for an improved user experience. I’ve installed HTTPS Everywhere as a Chrome Extension (https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) to force the secure protocol connection on non-configured sites.
